This Project regards the Second Class Assignment (CA) of the DevOps discipline at the .SWitCH() - Postgraduate in Software Development @ Instituto Superior de Engenharia do Porto, 2020/2021 edition.

For this CA the task was to utilize Gradle as a Build Tool using a provided simple chat application (Gradle Basic Demo).

The intention was to get familiar with different Gradle tasks and commands, in order to introduce the students to another Build Tool, since we were using Maven for the course main Project.

The _Part_1_ folder contains the first steps of using Gradle, like running some already defined tasks and creating tasks.

The _Part_2_ folder regards a more detailed exporation including dependencies and other tasks.

The _Part_2_Alternative_Implementation_ contains an attempt to implement an alternative Build Tool (it couldn't be Maven). In this case I chose **Bazel**.

All the named folders have a detailed _Readme_ representing the tutorial for each of the parts.
